## Link Testing Strategy

### Methodology

1. **Internal Links:** Verified all files exist at specified paths
2. **Amazon Links:** Updated to specific products or brand searches (less likely to break)
3. **Manufacturer Links:** Used official sites with product-specific URLs
4. **Distributor Links:** Added multiple alternatives (Adafruit, RobotShop, SparkFun)

### Link Longevity Best Practices Applied

✅ **Product-Specific ASINs** - Where available, used Amazon ASINs (e.g., B07CYNKLT4)  
✅ **Brand + Product Searches** - For common items, used brand name searches  
✅ **Multiple Sources** - Provided 2-3 alternatives for each component  
✅ **Official Sites** - Prioritized manufacturer direct links  
✅ **Generic Fallbacks** - Kept category searches for commodities

---

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ❌ Broken Links (Fixed)

1. **README.md** - `docs/architecture.md` → `docs/software_architecture.md`
2. **BOM.md** - Generic `amazon.com` links → Specific product searches/ASINs
3. **BOM.md** - Broken vendor sites → Removed or replaced with working alternatives

### ⚠️ Potential Future Issues

1. **Amazon ASINs** - Products may be discontinued (mitigated by adding searches)
2. **Price Fluctuations** - Noted "Prices subject to market fluctuation" in BOM
3. **Stock Availability** - Raspberry Pi 5 may have availability issues (noted in BOM)
