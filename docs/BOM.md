## Purchasing Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Electronics (Test Before Assembly)
1. Raspberry Pi 5 + Camera + SD Card
2. PCA9685 boards (x2)
3. Sample servos (2x PWM, 1x serial) for testing
4. Power system (battery, charger, UBECs)

### Phase 2: Sensors
1. ADS1115 ADC
2. FSR sensors (x4)
3. Resistor kit

### Phase 3: Full Actuation
1. Remaining PWM servos (14x)
2. All serial servos (10x or 9x if already purchased 1)

### Phase 4: Mechanical
1. PLA filament (start printing during electronics testing)
2. Hardware kit

### Phase 5: Enhancement
1. Silicone for grippers
2. Wiring and connectors
